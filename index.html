                <p class="answer">
                    I made a maze game in Construct 3. I started developing it on July 9, 2024, and I made it at iCode
                    Cypress, TX. I would like to make a progressive and storytelling platformer-like game in Construct 3
                    next because those attributes would add interest and gameplay to make a great game.
